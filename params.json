{"name":"DevStudyGuide","tagline":"Developer Study Guide","body":"Platform Developer Study Guide\r\n==============================\r\n\r\nEvery now and then, we meet a developer who might like to work for One iota, but isn't quite ready for one reason or another. Over the years, we've directed them to various resources, suggested small projects, and offered advice on things to swot up on. We've decided to put that advice together in one public document so that we might develop it further.\r\n\r\nIn the MESH Platform team of One iota, we're what you might call 'half stack' developers. We look after everything from a machine-readable API down to databases and other back-end services. We very rarely get directly involved in front-end coding. The skills and techniques below are things that _we_ find useful on a day to day basis. A rough covering of these areas will get you in a MESH frame of mind.\r\n\r\n##Key Skills\r\n\r\n###Object Oriented Programming\r\nWhere we can, we like to model problems as objects. We have objects that represent real things (e.g. `Product`, `Customer`, `Cart`) and objects that perform particular roles handling API requests and data (e.g. `PaymentController` or `DeliveryMethodMapper`).\r\n\r\nYou should be comfortable talking about objects, and be familiar with the design decisions around how to divide functionality into objects.\r\n\r\n####Recommended Reading\r\n- [Head First Java](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0596009208): It's a Java book, but has an excellent description of OOP concepts. OOP in PHP is largely ripped off from Java, so it will look pretty familiar. Feel free to skip the chapters on GUIs and Concurrency.\r\n\r\n###Design Patterns\r\nDesign Patterns are a useful common vocabulary for larger software systems. We'll quite often talk about a Strategy or an Observer, which can be a useful shorthand for a structure involving several classes and interfaces.\r\n\r\n####Recommended Reading\r\n- [Head First Design Patterns](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0596007124): Another Head First book. The books weigh a ton, but they do a great job of making some quite techy stuff readable. This is much more approachable than the classic [Gang of Four](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0201633612).\r\n\r\n###PHP\r\nTo say that PHP is our language of choice might be a bit strong. It's what we use. It has its idiosyncrasies, but it gets the job done.\r\n\r\nAn understanding of PHP isn't essential for new recruits --- people quickly learn to hate it like the rest of us --- but it may help to get a rough handle on it.\r\n\r\nIf you're coming from a statically typed language like Java or C#, you probably ought to know [some of the terrible things PHP does with types](http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.type-juggling.php).\r\n\r\nOtherwise, some [string manipulation](http://php.net/manual/en/book.strings.php) and a bit of [array bashing](http://php.net/manual/en/book.array.php) should stand you in good stead.\r\n\r\nIt may also help to know what's in the [PHP Standard Library](http://php.net/manual/en/book.spl.php). It contains several common data structures and nice object interfaces to handle common tasks (e.g. iterating over the filesystem).\r\n\r\n###Test-Driven Development\r\nWe're big fans of test-driven development. We use [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de) for unit tests and [Behat](http://behat.org) for end-to-end API tests. Those particular tools are far less important than the general concept of writing automated tests, and designing systems so that they can be tested.\r\n\r\n####Recommended Reading\r\n- [Test Driven Development](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0321146530) is the classic text on the practice, and is a good introduction.\r\n- [The Google Testing Blog](http://googletesting.blogspot.co.uk) is a great resource once you're up and running. In particular, their [Testing on the Toilet](http://googletesting.blogspot.co.uk/search/label/TotT) series of short articles cover best practices and common mistakes.\r\n\r\n### JSON\r\nJSON is a human-friendly machine-readable format, which we use pretty heavily, for APIs, config files, storage, all sorts. [There's not much to know about JSON itself](http://json.org), but it might help you to have a look. It would also be good to look at [how PHP handles JSON](http://php.net/json).\r\n\r\nIf you're feeling adventurous, you could take a look at [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org), which is a nice way of describing what can and should be in a JSON document. We use this to validate API requests, and to describe our APIs.\r\n\r\n###REST\r\nThis one can inspire raging debates with pseudo-religious fervour. Don't get bogged down in that, and don't bother with [Roy Fielding's dissertation](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/fielding_dissertation.pdf) unless you're feeling particularly scholarly. For us, all you really need to grok are:\r\n\r\n- [URIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_resource_identifier) as identifiers for resources\r\n- [HTTP methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods) and what they do\r\n- [Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS)\r\n\r\n####Recommended Reading\r\n- [RESTFul Web Services](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0596529260)\r\n- [Richardson Maturity Model](http://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html)\r\n\r\n###Cloud Infrastructure\r\nWe run everything in the [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com) cloud. We use quite a few of the services provided by AWS, such as [servers](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2), [storage](https://aws.amazon.com/s3), [relational databases](https://aws.amazon.com/rds), [NoSQL databases](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamo), [caches](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache), [message queues](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs), [deployment tools](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk), [infrastructure as code](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation), and more. It would be good to understand what these are and how you might use them to build large web-scale systems. If you haven't used these before, it _might_ help to look at how AWS does things. If you're familiar with them from somewhere else, don't worry too much about the AWS-specific details.\r\n\r\n####Amazon Web Services Terminology\r\nWe tend to assault new developers with a barrage of acronyms and initialisms. AWS is especially bad for this. If you're working on personal projects, you could do a lot worse than run them on AWS. That can give you a head start with the jargon.\r\n\r\n###Distributed Version Control\r\nWe've been using Mercurial since day one here, but we're steadily moving towards git.\r\n\r\n####Recommended Reading\r\n- [Atlassian's Git Tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials) are great.\r\n- [Joel Spolsky's HgInit](http://hginit.com) is a great introduction to Mercurial.\r\n\r\n###NoSQL Databases\r\nWe're steadily transitioning a lot of our data from a relational database (MySQL) to Amazon's [Dynamo DB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamo). Each of these 'NoSQL' databases have their own quirks and constraints, but a general understanding would be useful in assessing and reasoning about them.\r\n\r\n####Recommended Reading\r\n- [NoSQL Distilled](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0321826620) is a friendly survey of the field.\r\n- [Distributed Systems for Fun and Profit](http://book.mixu.net/distsys/) is a good read if you want to get into the details of how databases like these are built.\r\n\r\n###Relational Databases\r\nWe do still have a great deal of data in MySQL. Our use of MySQL isn't particularly fancy, so you'll find very little that wouldn't translate to another RDBMS. To be honest, it's rare we write a `GROUP_CONCAT()`, never mind a stored procedure. That said, some basic querying and relational database design can't hurt.\r\n\r\n###Cool Things We're Not Doing (Yet)\r\nIt's probably worth noting a few hot topics that we're _not_ actively pursuing right now. We wouldn't want to rule them out, but it's fair to say you'd be unlikely to use them on day one.\r\n\r\n- Agile Methodologies\r\n- Functional Programming\r\n- Big Data (Hadoop, etc.)\r\n- Machine Learning\r\n\r\n##Project Ideas\r\n\r\nHere are a couple of ideas for little projects --- some useful, some frivolous --- that would exercise a lot of the skills described above.\r\n\r\n###Email Service\r\n\r\nWe send hundreds of emails daily for customer sign-up, order confirmation, despatch notifications, etc. At present, our emailing code is tied up in the main platform codebase. We'd like to break out our emailing functions into a stand-alone service.\r\n\r\nThe service will need to:\r\n\r\n- Store/edit email templates. These will be HTML and plain text, with placeholders for variables.\r\n- Receive requests to send emails. It will need to put variables from the data given into placeholders, and integrate with Amazon Web Services' [Simple Email Service][SES] to send the email from the correct address.\r\n\r\nWe have some existing PHP code that could be used for parts of this.\r\n\r\n###Air Hockey Scoreboard\r\n\r\nA scoreboard system could:\r\n\r\n- Register players.\r\n- Keep track of games played.\r\n- Maintain leaderboard.\r\n- Compute statistics (most consistent, best defence, etc.)\r\n- Notify players if they haven't played for a while.\r\n\r\n[HipChat]: https://www.hipchat.com\r\n[SES]: https://aws.amazon.com/ses/\r\n[PD]: http://www.pagerduty.com\r\n[JIRA]: https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
